Mic Mute key
Procedure :

- Select the Mantella window to have the Focus
- Press F8 while the NPC is listening, an in-game message will confirm the "Microphone muted" command.
- Speak out loud once (e.g. say: Ok thanks.) just to make Whisper end listening mode on Mantella.
(Normally, Mantella goes into waiting mode, without listening to you but your microphone remains activated to continue VOIP in other applications)
- To reactivate the microphone, continue by pressing the F8 key again. an in-game message will confirm the "Microphone unmuted" command and listening mode will resume normally.
